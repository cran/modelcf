This package contains a generic way to build surrogate models of physical computer codes, when inputs are vectors (in R^p) and outputs (continuous) curves from [a,b] to R. The curves are discretized on a finite grid t1,...,tD.

-------------------------------------------

Main function to build a model = fmetam

-------------------------------------------

Main function to validate a model = nfoldcv


*******************************************

Main improvements over 2.0 version :
  - several bug fixes, especially for dimensionality reduction
  - several mehods added for intrinsic dimensionality estimation
  - possibility to better fit to the data by learning residuals
